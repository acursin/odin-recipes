        <h2 class="header">Description</h2>
        <p>Beef, pork, onions, and a smattering of dwarven seasoning are all rolled up into delicious little balls that are ideal for snacking or as a main banquet course. These "meatballs", as they are known to many in the multiverse, are sometimes served with a side of freshly crushed tart berries for dwarves on the go, but they are best when drenched in a sweet, dark dwarven gravy made with chicken broth and enlivened with brown sugar, lemon, and soy sauce. While these are customary consumables at Hornmoot, the traditional human-dwarven trading festival that marks the dawn of Spring, there isn't a holiday on the eventful dwarven calendar that doesn't feature these scrumptious meats on the menu.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 slices dark bread (such as rye), crusts discarded, remainder torn into pieces</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>8 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>8 ounces lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon  light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill or parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="header">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the cream and egg. Add the bread, mix well, and set aside, stirring occasionally, until the bread is softened, about 20 minutes. Using a fork or a sturdy spoon, mash the bread to a paste and set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the allspice and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Coat a large wire rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it in a large rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Add the cooled onion mixture, pork , ground beef, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper to the bread paste and, using a large spoon or your hands, mix until well combined and uniform.</li>
            <li>With moistened hands, form the mixture into generous 1-tablespoon-size balls. Arrange the meatballs on the rack in the baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 20 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the skillet used for the onions to remove any stray onion bits, set it over medium heat, and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stirring constantly, cook until fragrant and a shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Switch to a whisk and, whisking constantly, gradually add the broth. Continuing to whisk often, cook for about 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and continue to whisk and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 4 minutes. Stir in most of the dill and taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with the remaining dill, and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

            <h3 class="header">Cook's Note</h3>
            <p>The sauce will thicken quickly as it cools. You can loosen the consistency by whisking in extra chicken broth or water, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have achieved the desired texture.</p>
