        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The tabaxi are long-tailed, feline humanoids known for their innately inquisitive and mercurial spirit, as well as agile hunting prowess. Also referred to as "Jaguar People" or "Leopard People" depending on their build and fur color, the tabaxi cat people of Maztica are particularly dangerous predators, but one still wonders how often they had the occasion to prey on cockatrices. Tabaxi are extremely particular about how they prepare their birds, and there is no denying that these extra-crispy chicken wings dusted with a zesty dry rub will please even the most finicky eater. The recipe is a jealously guarded secret and tabaxi can't keep their paws off them.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 pounds chicken wings, halved at the joints, wing tips removed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons garam masala powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Set a wire rack in a large rimmed baking sheet.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with the baking powder to coat. Add the salt and pepper and toss again to coat.Arrange the wings skin-side up on the wire rack and roast for 40 minutes. Adjust the heat to 425 degrees F and continue to roast until the wings are golden brown and crisp , about 40 minutes more. Sprinkle the wings with the garam masala and continue to roast for 10 minutes more. Using tongs, carefully remove the wings from the rack. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        <p>The initial roasting at the lower oven temperature allows the fat to render, which aids in crisping the skin, as does the baking powder.</p>
